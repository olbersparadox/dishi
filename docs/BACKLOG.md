# Dishi Backlog

Single source of truth for outstanding work. Triage/specs happen in the Claude
Project; execution happens in Claude Code. When an item ships: check it off with
the commit hash. When a new item is decided anywhere: add it here and push.

Model tier per item: **[S]** = Sonnet (well-specified build) · **[F]** = Fable/Opus
(design decisions, entity resolution, diagnosis).

## Now

- [ ] **[S] 語言對 fixes (live-test failures).** Japanese-menu acceptance test
  fails on ec16af0: scan z-instruction never received the katakana/false-friend
  hardening (it landed only in nameTranslate.ts), and bilingual menus defeat
  menuLanguageToCode so the foreign-secondary preset never fires. v2: prompt wording alone is unreliable on the skeleton model (qwen) — add the
  kana/hangul tripwire that re-authors z through the proven translate path, plus
  chip label-dedupe.
  Full spec: `docs/specs/language-pair-globe-fixes.md`.
- [ ] **[F] dishi — your AI palate (export redesign).** Replace "prompt export"
  with a persona: the user's palate, unlocked (not given) once the engine
  genuinely knows enough, written in a user-chosen voice, leveling up as the
  engine learns — each version visibly knows MORE (dishes, dates, places,
  home-cook patterns). Unified confidence-as-level bar with honest endowed
  progress on day 1; day-1 export locked, album-logging tutorial as the fast
  path to first unlock. Engine-adjacent (buddy level rebase) — use Opus.
  Full spec: `docs/specs/dishi-palate-export.md`.
- [ ] **[S] OTP login (kill the magic-link browser trap).** Code-as-hero email,
  `autoComplete="one-time-code"` for iOS keyboard autofill, code entry as the
  primary login path. Mostly template + a few lines; verifyOtp path already
  exists. Full spec: `docs/specs/otp-login.md`.

- [x] **[F] Queued picks (待評菜式) rate through the NEW flow.** ✅ DONE `ca65a8a`.
  The rate icon opened `/log?rate=<id>` (the old single-dish page); it now opens
  RatingStack in `picksMode` — flick card → growth screen, same as the album path.
  **Owner chose (a):** ✕ on a pick is a plain close, the flicked rating stands, and
  correction goes through 重新評分 in 食記 (which replays full history, so it's
  engine-correct and never re-seals). (b) — a real un-rate — was rejected because
  sending a dish back to 待評 with its prediction ALREADY REVEALED lets the re-rating
  be made with dishi's guess in hand, which corrupts the sealed-bet contract and makes
  the streak gameable. Two independent guards ensure a pick is never deleted:
  `cancelSession` early-returns in picksMode, and no `onCancel` is passed to
  TasteGrowth (its `onCancel ?? onExit` fallback makes ✕ close-and-keep).
  `?unrated=1` now also returns `photo_url`/`lat`/`lng` for the card + nearby seed.

## Next

- [ ] **[F] Persona rethink (老實派 / 食家腔 / 貪玩) — dedicated design session.**
  The in-card picker was REMOVED from the export card (2026-07-21): as a row of
  chips it wasn't doing anything a user could feel. Open design question: where
  and how does a persona actually interact with the user? If the character is
  only "alive" after export inside the user's own AI, the whole feature needs a
  dedicated session to design and build (voice in the exported prompt is already
  implemented — `persona.ts` voices + persistence are kept, default 'honest').
  Also open: the 貪玩 blurb "鬼馬、生動、港式抵死" is defined by its Cantonese
  cheek — 書面化 would be a rename/reframe, decide in the same session.
- [ ] **[S] Bilingual ingredient display.** The ingredients line under the diet
  chips (DishInfoDisplay) shows lowercase English as stored today. Give ingredients
  a zh/en pair so the line reads native in Chinese-first mode. Deferred out of the
  diet-flag-integrity work; needs its own small vocabulary/translation pass.
- [ ] **[F] Diet taxonomy growth (gluten, soy, nuts-general).** The 雞扎 fix took
  DIET_FLAGS from 7 → 13 (added poultry/lamb/egg/dairy/offal). Further allergen
  axes are real but each needs its own recipe-grounding thought — do NOT bolt them
  on ad hoc; keep the vocabulary closed and deliberate.
- [ ] **[S] Seal at pick time.** Move seal creation (`POST /api/seals`) from
  queue-load to the pick-confirm moment on the scan page, so the prediction is
  committed when the user ORDERS, not when they next open the Taste tab.
  Strengthens the honesty framing; small change, endpoint already idempotent.
- [ ] **[F] 食記 ordering for album logs.** Old camera-roll photos have a fuzzy
  eaten-date; decide: order journal by when-eaten vs when-logged, and how to
  capture an approximate eaten-date at log time without adding friction.
  Design conversation first — do not build straight from this line.

## Later / standing

- [ ] **Strategy: consumer scan density.** One dense neighborhood before
  expanding; no friend graph at this stage. Not a code item.
- Brainstormed, NOT confirmed (do not build): weekly recap card · web push
  re-entry triggers · revisit prompt ("would you order it again?") · 地雷
  dealbreaker probe · 排個名 restaurant mini-ranking · tempt-duel at scan time ·
  cold-start popularity ranking for profileless users · reverse taste import.

## Done (recent, for context)

- [x] **語言對 — the globe picker (language-pair dish names)** — pair state +
  globe UI + on-the-fly translation; persisted dishes.names cache + scan prompt
  hardening; foreign-scan preset + printed-original fidelity rule + langPair
  tests. `c28ae7a`, `d7112a5`, `ec16af0` (supersedes the standalone
  multilingual-scan-hardening idea; also absorbs the old "taste export recurring
  loop" open question — that loop is now designed into the palate export above)
- [x] **對決 — pairwise taste duels** — learning math (pairwise logistic on the
  attribute contrast) with a 揀唔落 tie signal, active pair selection, GET/POST duel
  API (prediction sealed server-side), header notification bell + floating card,
  merged into replay. Simulation-tuned: the spec's p-formula flatlined the error
  signal (contentScore ÷18 → p≈0.5), corrected to the un-normalized Bradley-Terry
  logit (K 4→2); tie weight tuned to 0.2. Sim (5 seeds × 30 users): overall ranking
  no degradation, low-evidence-dim sign accuracy +2.2pp. `3291d42`, `d590264`
- [x] Vision reliability: retry unparseable responses + honest "couldn’t read"
  card for true failures (was silently logging "Unknown dish" as is_dish:true).
  `82089d8`, `b1e76c4`
- [x] Diet-flag integrity fix (雞扎 problem) — taxonomy 7→13, recipe-grounded
  enrichment, dietSuspicion tripwire, ingredients line surfaced, bounded backfill
  script. `52fd013`
- [x] Three-path log entry (餐廳菜/屋企煮/相簿舊相) — landed in the same commit
  as the diet-flag fix. `52fd013`
- [x] Sealed-bet mechanic end-to-end + RLS/admin-client fix (印 stamp live in prod)
- [x] Scan persistence across tab switches (`src/lib/scanSession.ts`)
- [x] Taste tab redesign: black radar, bold top-3, progress bar, stat sizing
- [x] Owner menu authority tier + `tests/ownerMenuReconcile.test.ts`
- [x] dishes.source constraint widened live (fixed silent no-photo log failure)


# Backlog additions — 2026-07-20 (restaurant picker ×3 + HK menu shorthand)

Context: real field session at Tin Wan, 2026-07-20 ~13:49 HKT. 新容記 (well-known,
user was standing in it) absent from the picker chips; typing it and tapping 加入
produced no visible result; Vercel logs confirm `/api/dishes/pick` was never
called — the picks were lost. Same scan: 干炒牛河 shipped with a 飯 ingredient
chip and the literal English "Dry Fried Beef River"; a separate menu's 炆米 came
out as 炆飯.

---

## 1. Picker: 加入 must produce visible selected state — *(Sonnet)*

**Bug class:** silent success indistinguishable from silent failure.

In `src/components/RestaurantPicker.tsx`, a successful `createNew()` sets
`selectedKey='manual-new'` — which corresponds to no rendered element — and
leaves the add form open, input untouched. Nothing on screen changes. Users
reasonably conclude the tap failed and cancel, discarding the staged choice.
Two additional genuinely-silent paths exist: `confirmNew()` returns wordlessly
when `coords` is null, and the `namesMatch` same-place nudge can render below
the iOS keyboard.

**Changes:**
- On `createNew()`: collapse the add form and render the typed name as a
  selected chip in the chip row (same `on` styling as picking a nearby chip),
  with a small affordance to reopen/edit. `selectedKey='manual-new'` now maps
  to a real element.
- Tapping the manual chip again reopens the form pre-filled (edit, not
  re-type).
- The `!coords` early-return must speak: the `picker.needloc` line already
  exists — ensure it is visible *at the moment of the tap* (e.g. brief
  highlight), not just passively present.
- When the same-place nudge (`picker.sameas`) appears, scroll it into view /
  ensure it isn't under the keyboard (`scrollIntoView` on mount is
  acceptable).

**Tests:** component test — after typing + 加入, the chip row contains the
typed name with selected styling and the form is collapsed; reopening
preserves the text.

---

## 2. Typed-name resolution via Places Text Search — *(build: Sonnet; design decided here)*

**Problem:** Nearby Search is capped at 10 prominence-ranked results; in dense
HK a well-known spot routinely misses the cut. Manual adds then create
`place_id`-less rows — exactly the fragmentation the restaurant-identity work
(backlog: restaurant identity resolution) exists to prevent.

**Design (confirmed): search-on-add, not typeahead.** When the user taps 加入,
FIRST call a new endpoint `GET /api/restaurants/search?q=..&lat=..&lng=..`
which runs Places Text Search (New, `places:searchText`) with:
- `locationBias` circle at the picker's coords (~1km radius),
- same minimal field mask as `places.ts` (`places.id,places.displayName,places.location,places.formattedAddress`),
- `languageCode` from the app language, `maxResultCount` ~5.

Then:
- **Match(es) found** → show them via the existing same-place nudge UI,
  extended to hold multiple candidates ("係咪呢間？" + chips). Picking one goes
  through the normal Google-chip path → carries a real `place_id` → server
  dedup works.
- **No match / user rejects all** → `createNew()` as today (manual,
  `place_id`-less — still allowed, never blocked).

Rejected alternative: live search-as-you-type. Every keystroke-debounced query
is a billed call with no cache locality; search-on-add is exactly one call per
add attempt and slots into the existing nudge UX.

**Cost discipline (mirror the places.ts comment):** implementation MUST verify
in the current Google pricing table which SKU tier this field mask lands
Text Search in, and note it in the code comment. Volume is bounded (one call
per manual add), no cache needed. Confirm the existing daily quota cap covers
the new endpoint.

**Tests:** endpoint unit test with mocked fetch (bias + field mask asserted);
picker test for the multi-candidate nudge path and the reject→manual path.

---

## 3. Nearby list: distance ranking, no Google cap — *(Sonnet)* — ✅ DONE `d661536`

Two changes in `src/app/api/restaurants/nearby/route.ts` + `src/lib/places.ts`:

1. `rankPreference: 'DISTANCE'` on the `places:searchNearby` body — the 10
   Google slots become the *nearest* 10, not the most prominent 10. (With
   DISTANCE ranking, check the API's requirements: `radius` +
   `rankPreference` interplay per current docs — adjust the
   `locationRestriction` accordingly if the API rejects the combination.)
2. Remove the `slice(0, 8 - dishi.length)` squeeze entirely. Show ALL Dishi
   rows (RPC already caps at 8) plus ALL deduped Google results (max 10).
   Explicit product decision: no combined cap — the chip row wraps; a longer
   honest list beats a short wrong one.

**Cache note:** bump/namespace the `places_cache` bucket key (e.g. suffix
`:v2`) so pre-change prominence-ranked cached results don't serve for up to
12h after deploy.

**Tests:** update nearby route test — no slicing; assert `rankPreference` is
sent.

---

## 4. HK menu shorthand: 炆米 ≠ 炆飯 — carb metonym integrity — *(Fable 5)* — ✅ DONE `ca6ed92`

Glossary (4a) + carbSuspicion tripwire (4b) + tests/eval/backfill (4c) shipped.
FOLLOW-UP still open: the tripwire corrects ingredients/diet, not the attribute
VECTOR or an already-polluted NAME — honest vector re-score needs the name
re-authored first (translate/vision + authority ladder). Recommended next; costs
one more LLM call per fire.

**Priority: high, trust-critical** — same family as diet-flag integrity. The
scan misreads HK menu metonyms where the carb is named by single-character
shorthand: 米 = 米粉 (rice noodles), 河 = 河粉, 意 = 意粉, 通 = 通粉,
丁 = 出前一丁, 治 = 三文治, 多/西多 = 西多士. Observed in production:
炆米 → "炆飯"; 干炒牛河 → 飯 ingredient chip + "Dry Fried Beef River".
A wrong carb pollutes the English name, ingredient chips, diet-adjacent
reasoning, AND the 18-dim attribute vector — bad data straight into the taste
engine.

**Design principles (carried over from diet-flag v2 — do not regress):**
- Strings never author; they only trip a re-check.
- `name_original` ("o") stays verbatim always — misreadings may only ever
  live in derived fields, which are correctable.

**Three legs:**

### 4a. Prompt glossary
New shared constant `HK_MENU_SHORTHAND_GUIDANCE` (in `nameTranslate.ts`
alongside `ZH_FROM_MENU_GUIDANCE`, or `menuScan.ts` — implementer's call, one
place only). Content: expand HK shorthand *before* deriving anything —
compact glossary of the metonyms above plus 齋 prefix, 底 (麵底/飯底), and
the explicit trap that 米 in a cooked-dish name means 米粉, not rice, while
粟米/蝦米/米芝蓮 do NOT (component words, not shorthand). English names must
be the *known dish* name, never character-literal ("beef chow fun", not
"beef river"). Inject into all relevant prompt sites: both `SCAN_PROMPTS`
members, `ENRICH_SYSTEM`, and the vision prompt sites — extend the existing
`SCAN_PROMPTS` embedding test to assert the new constant is present in each,
so it can't silently drop (the mechanism that already guards the z-rule).

### 4b. Mechanical tripwire: `carbSuspicion()`
Pure, exported, unit-tested function in `menuScan.ts`, modeled on
`dietSuspicion`: fires when the printed/zh name carries a noodle morpheme
(米 in dish position, 河, 麵/面, 粉, 意, 通, 丁) but derived
ingredients/name say rice — or the reverse. Requires a `CARB_NAME_TRAPS`
neutralization list first (粟米, 蝦米, 米芝蓮, 河內?, 沙河?, …) — this list
is the judgment-heavy core and why this item is Fable 5; curate it against
real HK menu vocabulary, err toward neutralizing (worst case of a missed
fire is status quo; worst case of a false fire is one harmless re-ask).
On suspicion at enrichment: ONE re-ask with an appended correction line,
mirroring `DIET_RECHECK_LINE`.

### 4c. Regression fixture + bounded backfill
- Vitest table for `carbSuspicion` covering: 干炒牛河, 蝦子炆米, 星洲炒米,
  肉醬意, 火腿通, 餐蛋丁, 西多, 蛋治, and the neutralized non-fires
  (粟米斑塊飯, 蝦米), etc.
- Manual eval script `scripts/eval-hk-shorthand.ts` (pattern:
  `backfill-diet-flags.ts`): runs the live enrich path over the fixture
  set, prints derived carb/ingredients vs expected — run by hand after
  prompt changes, not CI.
- One-off backfill: run `carbSuspicion` over stored `dishes`, re-enrich only
  the suspicious subset, dry-run first, `--apply` to write. Same auditable
  before/after output as the diet backfill.

**Open question for implementation (flag, don't decide silently):** whether
the tripwire should also gate the *attribute vector* re-score, or only
name/ingredients — re-scoring costs a second LLM call per fire. Recommend
yes (the vector is what the engine eats) but surface the cost when building.

# Backlog additions — 2026-07-21 (rating-stack upload failure + rename re-derivation)

Context: real field session, 2026-07-21 ~02:34 HKT, onboarding growth screen
(建立個人化口味 AI / RatingStack + TasteGrowth). Five photos rated. Vercel logs:
first photo's `POST /api/dishes` rejected **413** at the platform edge at
18:34:24 UTC (body over the ~4.5MB serverless cap — never reached the route);
the other four succeeded seconds later. Rename PATCH on dish 2 succeeded
(18:36:10, 200) and `/api/dishes/enrich` fired after it (18:36:22, 200), yet
the ingredient chips never changed.

---

## 1. Photo upload size cap + failed-card honesty — *(Sonnet)* — ✅ DONE `b6d3c58` (unified on normalizePhoto; failed card = notice + retry, no queued-rename needed since edit UI is absent on failed cards)

**Two root causes, one card:**
- The 413 happens at Vercel's edge (~4.5MB serverless body limit — not
  raisable), so oversized photos fail before any code runs.
- `RatingStack.runPipeline` marks the card `status:'failed'`, but TasteGrowth
  renders a failed card nearly identically to a healthy one: photo + score
  word + empty name pill + place chips. No error, no retry. Then
  `onEditName`/`onPickPlace` hit `if (!gd?.dishId) return;` — the user's
  typed name silently goes nowhere. (Same silent-failure shape as the picker
  加入 bug and the historical `dishes.source` constraint — this class keeps
  recurring; fix the instance AND keep the pattern in mind.)

**Changes:**
- **Client-side downscale before upload.** Shared util (check what the /log
  flow does today and unify — do not fork a second resize path): longest edge
  ~2000px, JPEG re-encode, target well under the cap (~3MB ceiling). Applies
  to RatingStack and any other photo POST that lacks it.
- **Failed card states its failure.** Reuse the existing honesty copy pattern
  (`log.visionfail.*` distinguishes "nobody ever looked" from "looked and said
  not food" — this is the former). Show a retry affordance; the File object is
  still in memory in `prepared`, so retry = re-run `runPipeline` for that
  index with the (now downscaled) file.
- **No silent no-ops on a dishId-less card.** Rename/place actions on a
  failed card either (a) are visibly disabled with the failure notice, or
  (b) queue locally and auto-apply after a successful retry. Prefer (b) for
  the rename — the person already typed the name; don't make them re-type.
- The 413 response never reaches route code, so the fix is client-side
  detection: `!res.ok` already catches it — the gap is presentation, plus
  prevention via downscale.

**Tests:** unit test the downscale util (dimension + size ceiling); component
test that a failed card shows the failure state and that rename-on-failed
queues and applies after retry.

---

## 2. Rename → REAL re-derivation (kill the simulated re-enrich) — *(Fable 5)* — ✅ DONE `b6d3c58` (force mode + enrichGen; PATCH reanalyzeAnchored left in place — name-seeded result lands after it, so the typed name wins; route/component tests skipped — repo has no route/component test infra, glossary+eval pinned instead)

**Root cause chain (all three layers confirmed in code):**
1. `/api/dishes/enrich` early-returns when `dish.attributes` is non-empty —
   built as first-time-only enrichment. A post-rename call is a guaranteed
   no-op. Worse, the early-return path returns NO `ingredients` (the
   pass-through only exists on the full-run path).
2. `RatingStack.onEditName` patches `name`/`name_zh`/`diet` from the PATCH
   response but ingredients never flow into `live` state.
3. `TasteGrowth.reReenrich` is an acknowledged simulation (see its own
   comment): blanks the chips, waits 720ms, restores the OLD `ing`. The UI
   performs a re-analysis that never happened — an honesty violation by the
   product's own standards.

**Decided behavior — typed name is the derivation seed.** After a human
rename, re-derivation reasons from the NEW name (text enrichment path), not
from the photo. This follows the existing name-authority ladder
(`AUTHORITY_HUMAN > AUTHORITY_VISION`): the person just told us what the dish
IS; a photo-anchored re-analysis (`reanalyzeAnchored`) can keep contradicting
them (the 鴨-beats-油雞 failure observed live). The photo remains support
evidence, never override. If implementation finds `reanalyzeAnchored` inside
the PATCH cascade writing photo-derived fields AFTER this change, resolve in
favor of the typed name and note what moved.

**Changes:**
- `/api/dishes/enrich`: accept `{ force: true }` (or a sibling
  `re-derive` action — implementer's call, one endpoint preferred). Force
  mode: re-run `inferCuisineFromName` + `scoreOneDish` + `enrichOneDish`
  seeded from the CURRENT (post-rename) name, overwrite
  attributes/diet/cooking_method/heaviness, and ALWAYS return `ingredients`
  — including on any remaining early-return path.
- **Profile heal:** the existing rating learned from the old attributes. The
  route already contains the correct pattern (replayProfile + taste_profiles
  upsert when a rating exists) — ensure force mode runs it too. This is the
  re-rating-corruption lesson applied to attribute changes: replay, never
  layer.
- `RatingStack`: `onEditName`/`onReclassify` call enrich with force after the
  rename PATCH resolves; patch `ingredients`, `diet`, `heaviness`,
  `enriched` from the response into `live` state.
- `TasteGrowth`: delete the 720ms `setTimeout` simulation. `reenriching`
  becomes data-driven: set true when the rename commits, cleared when the
  live row's post-rename enrichment lands (compare against a
  rename-generation counter, not field equality — the new ingredients could
  coincidentally match the old). Chips animate out on commit, in on real
  arrival. Remove the `p.ing.length === 0` guard's early return for the
  live path — a just-named dish with no prior chips is exactly the case that
  NEEDS a first derivation.
- Sim mode (snapdemo, no auth) keeps the timeout animation — it's honest
  there because the whole screen is declared a demo.

**Cost note:** force mode = one extra `scoreOneDish` + `enrichOneDish` per
rename. Renames are rare and human-initiated; acceptable. No debounce needed
beyond ignoring stale in-flight responses (generation counter).

**Tests:** route test — force mode overwrites and returns ingredients;
replay runs when a rating exists. Component test — rename sets
`reenriching`, old chips never reappear, new chips land from the live patch.

---

## 3. Glossary addition: 油雞 false-friend — *(rider on the shipped shorthand glossary; Sonnet)* — ✅ DONE `b6d3c58`

Observed live: 油雞髀 rendered as "Fried Chicken Thigh" — 油雞 is soy-poached
chicken (豉油雞), not fried; 油 here is the poaching liquor, not deep-frying.
Add to the existing HK shorthand/false-friend guidance (one line, both the
scan glossary and translate guidance if they're separate constants), plus one
fixture row in the shorthand eval set: 油雞髀 → poached/soy chicken, cooking
method NOT fried.

While in there: quick pass for siblings of the same shape — 白切雞 (poached,
not "white cut" literalism is fine but method = poached), 手撕雞 (shredded,
not "hand-torn" as method), 風沙雞 (fried garlic crumb, not "wind-sand").
Add only ones that fit in a line or two; the glossary must stay compact to
stay obeyed.

# Backlog additions — 2026-07-21 (dishi version ladder + taste-page/growth UI batch)

Context: field session 09:40–09:44 HKT on the 味 AI page and growth screen.
Product decision (Jerry, confirmed): "Level" becomes "Version" — same growth
substrate, better framing for this product. Versions are UNBOUNDED (v99,
v123, …), early ones unlock fast, later ones need progressively more signal.
The habit loop: every new version unlock → export to your AI. Deep version
semantics and per-version perks are EXPLICITLY DEFERRED to a design session
with Jerry — do not invent perks; build the mechanical scaffold only.

---

## 1. Unbounded version ladder (replaces Levels) — *(Fable 5)* — ✅ DONE `89c36f3` (v1≡export-unlock structural; substrate (rc/25)^0.75 + capped dims + uncapped cuisines; gaps 0.65×1.25^n; ratchet column version_unlocked applied live; 13 tests incl. pacing snapshot)

**Core:** new pure module function `versionForProfile(inputs) →
{ version, progress, nextAt }` alongside the existing buddy math.

**Constraints (hard):**
- **v1 ≡ export unlock.** "dishi v1 已經解鎖" and "can export" must be the
  same fact, derived from the same number — never two thresholds that can
  disagree. Anchor v1 to the existing `UNLOCK_CONFIDENCE` signal level.
- **Unbounded + monotone.** Confidence saturates at 1.0, so versions cannot
  ride the confidence scale forever. Substrate: cumulative honest signal
  (the same inputs evidenceConfidence weighs — ratings, explored dims,
  distinct cuisines — accumulated, not saturated). Diversity keeps its
  outsized weight; the 30th identical ramen still teaches ~nothing.
- **Early-easy, later-hard.** Threshold spacing grows (geometric or
  quadratic — implementer's judgment): v2 within roughly a good first week
  of normal use; by v10+ each version is a real undertaking. Tune against
  Jerry's live account as the reference curve (25 flicks / 8 cuisines /
  10 explored dims ≈ should sit at v1, partway to v2).
- **Replay-safe + ratcheted.** Version must be recomputable from ratings
  history (no drift, same principle as profile replay). RECOMMENDED (flag,
  Jerry has not ruled): achieved version RATCHETS — it's an unlock history,
  so deleting a rating never demotes; the progress bar toward next version
  reflects live signal and may dip. Note the tradeoff in code comment.
- **Naming:** "dishi v{n}" everywhere. Animal level names (Hatchling…) exit
  the UI. Keep or delete `CONFIDENCE_LEVELS` internally as implementation
  convenience, but nothing user-facing speaks Levels.
- **Export unification:** the export's own version stamp (`export.delta`
  v{v} copy) becomes the SAME number — dishi v2 unlock generates the v2
  export with visible deltas since v1. This is the profile-versioning
  engagement loop from the standing backlog, now with its unlock trigger.

**UI (from the screenshots):**
- 「V{n}」 label left of the 識咗/摸緊 line; 「V{n+1}」 at the bar's right
  end; bar spans full stat-line width and shows progress between the two
  version thresholds (not raw confidence).
- Unlock-moment copy 「Taste AI 1.0 Ready 喇」 fires ONCE at first v1
  unlock, then steady-state 「dishi v{n} 已經解鎖」 + dynamic
  progress-to-next copy. Kill the "Taste AI 1.0" naming.
- Export CTA copy → 「dishi v{n} 植入」, font size/weight matched to the
  locked-state 「再評多 {n} 味就生成到」 line. Vermillion stays — this
  button is one of its two sanctioned uses.

**Tests:** curve monotonicity; v1==export-unlock equivalence; ratchet
behavior; replay determinism; early-version pacing snapshot (so a future
curve tweak is a conscious diff, not an accident).

---

## 2. Auto-seal on version unlock — *(fold into item 1, Fable 5)* — ✅ DONE `89c36f3` (shared stakeSeal helper, strongest |contentScore| unrated dish, honest no-op when none; /api/seals refactored onto the same core)

At the moment a new version unlocks, the engine stakes ONE sealed
prediction (reuse `sealed_predictions` wholesale — no new tables/UI): its
strongest-confidence call about a dish direction the user hasn't confirmed
yet. Every "dishi v{n} 已經解鎖" ships with the engine putting its
reputation on the line; reveal follows the existing seal reveal flow.

**Known gap (Jerry, explicit):** users don't yet understand what the seal
IS. Ship the mechanic, then schedule a deep-dive review on delivering /
educating the essence of it — capture reveal-rate + streak data meanwhile
so that review has numbers. Do not add explanatory UI beyond existing copy
in this pass.

---

## 3. Tappable stat boxes with explainer layer — *(Sonnet)* — ✅ DONE `713f645` (scrim+sheet pattern, 書面語 copy grounded in real buddy.ts/tasteExport.ts semantics)

引擎強度 / 滑動 / 菜系 / 味覺調校 each tappable → popover/sheet, same
presentation pattern as the globe & notification icons. Four short
bilingual blurbs, written from the REAL engine semantics (書面語 register,
these are explainers):
- 引擎強度: how much signal the taste vector is built on — ratings ×
  variety × cuisines; diversity counts extra; this number gates nothing
  falsely (it IS the version substrate).
- 滑動: total dishes rated.
- 菜系: distinct cuisines with real ratings.
- 味覺調校: of 18 tracked dimensions, how many have crystallized into an
  actual preference (clear of noise) — stricter than 識咗, which only needs
  enough evidence to trust a reading.
Copy drafted at build time from `buddy.ts`/`tasteExport.ts` semantics; must
stay true if thresholds move (reference constants, don't hardcode claims).

## 4. Growth screen: REAL blob, not the dev mockup — *(Sonnet)* — ✅ DONE `713f645` (blobForm.ts sampleForm/formToSvgPath, seeded from the live /api/buddy vector/evidence/ratingCount, userId threaded through)

The growth screen's header circle is a static dev-mock blob. Replace with
the real `blobForm` render seeded from the live profile
(`${userId}:v${profileVersion}` — note: profileVersion ties into item 1's
version number once unified), updating as ratings commit during the
session. A new user's blob will be small and plain — that is correct
behavior, not a regression. Remove the mock asset so it can't return.

## 5. Absorb-effect words in Chinese — *(Sonnet)* — ✅ DONE `713f645` (extracted the existing DishInfoDisplay ingredient→zh glossary to src/lib/ingredientLabel.ts, shared by both; note: dishes never actually carried a zh ingredient field — that premise was inaccurate, this glossary is the real source)

The learned-attribute absorb animation mostly emits English tokens
("seaweed", "rice"). When app language is zh: dimension words use the
existing `dim.*` zh labels; ingredient words use the ingredient zh names
already carried on the dish. English only when no zh label exists. (The
9:41 screenshot shows 奶類 + "rice" side by side — mixed register, fix.)

---

## 6. Small UI batch — *(Sonnet, one pass)* — ✅ DONE `713f645` (chip contrast in growth-screen location row; root-caused + fixed the black-banner bleed-through: backdrop brightness() can't lift true black, swapped the glass tint for a real paper-alpha wash)

- 加間舖 / 略過 / 住家菜 chips: darker text color (current --ink-soft on
  glaze reads too faint on the dark-banner overlay context).
- Black banner's blurred backdrop: lighten / lower alpha — currently too
  dark, crushes the header area (9:42 screenshot).

Deferred by decision: version semantics deep-design, per-version perks
(fun factor, smarter AI instructions per taste), seal education — all
Jerry+Claude design sessions, not implementation tickets.


# Backlog additions — 2026-07-21 (Table Mode social: one surface, chops, echo)

Context: field session 18:41 HKT, two-person table R4E87. The joiner still
renders the PRE-redesign table layout (score rings, old cards) while the host
sees the new 你的最佳選擇 list — two products stapled together. Confirmed
design (Jerry): one shared surface; chop-first identity (photos later);
realtime pick stamps; companion data layer; 檯友回音 echo rider; guests
without accounts CAN stamp picks (friction kills tables) but generate no
companion edge / echo until sign-up — a deliberate conversion hook.

Strategic frame: two people picking at one table generates PAIRED dish-level
demand data no POS or QR vendor can see. Social is where the moat compounds.

---

## 1. One shared table surface — *(Sonnet)* — ✅ DONE `2f5b39b`

Delete the joiner's legacy view. Every member of a table session renders the
SAME new 你的最佳選擇 list (讀到 N 道菜 header, numbered rows, price, chips,
footer bar). Per-person differences are limited to:
- ranking blend when 2+ taste profiles are present (existing 有兩個或以上口味
  檔案入檯 behavior keeps its engine semantics — presentation unifies, math
  doesn't change in this item);
- your own picks highlighted as yours.
The old table components are removed, not feature-flagged — they must not be
reachable. 離開 / invite / table code chrome carries over onto the unified
header.

**Tests:** joiner and host snapshot the same component tree for the same
session state.

Shipped as scan's own settled-list grammar (scan-item/scan-rank rows, no
rings) ported onto the table's group_match data — math untouched, only the
render changed. `unanimous` turned out to be trivially true for a small/
single-member table (every profiled member's raw score clears a low floor),
so the 🔥 mark is capped to the top 3 by group_match — the same discipline
scan already applies to its own fire winners (there: top 2 by raw_score) —
found and fixed during live testing, not spec'd. Component-tree snapshot
tests were dropped for the same reason every later item's spec'd test
plan changed: **this repo has no component/DOM test harness** (confirmed
against the b6d3c58 precedent) — verified live in the browser instead
(a real table session, screenshotted, then cleaned up).

---

## 2. Chop identity (名印) — *(Sonnet)* — ✅ DONE `5ca23a0`

Avatar = a small ink 印章 bearing the first character of the display name
(first letter if Latin), deterministically styled from user id (seeded
variation in border/rotation/weight — same user always renders the same
chop). One-time setup on first table join or first social surface: type a
display name, done. No photo upload infra in v1; photo override is a later
item.

**Hard constraint:** chops render in INK (--ink on --glaze), never
vermillion. Vermillion remains reserved for the seal glyph and the AI-export
CTA. Do not ship a red chop no matter how good it looks — this is the one
place the temptation will be strongest.

- Display-name uniqueness NOT required; disambiguate by chop styling + full
  name on long-press/tap.
- Existing auto-handles (mosuko-i47v) become the fallback display name until
  the user sets one; prompt once, never nag.
- New table: `profiles.display_name` (or equivalent — implementer verifies
  current profile table shape via Supabase MCP before migrating). Migration
  saved to `supabase/applied/` per standing pattern.

**Tests:** deterministic chop render for fixed id; fallback name path.

`src/lib/chop.ts` (chopGlyph + deriveChopStyle, seededRandom-based — reuses
blobForm.ts's existing hash rather than a new one) + `src/components/Chop.tsx`.
`profiles.display_name` added (`supabase/applied/profiles_display_name.sql`).
"Never nag" implemented as a device-local `dishi_chop_prompt_dismissed`
localStorage flag (no server-side "dismissed" state — the handle fallback is
a fully valid permanent choice). Vermillion constraint honored: the ONLY red
in this feature is the pre-existing dish-edit dirty-save convention on the
SAVE button, never the chop glyph itself. 9 tests. Verified live: saved a
real display_name, confirmed via direct DB query, then reverted it and the
test table session — nothing left in the live account.

**Amended `94b0680` (owner review, 2026-07-21):** the per-user rotation/
variable-radius/border-weight above shipped as spec'd, but read as the
app's separate 印 ink-seal motif rather than Table Mode's own clean look —
swapped for a plain uniform circle with initials, no shape variation.
`deriveChopStyle`/`ChopStyle` deleted (unused after the swap); `chopGlyph`
unchanged. 4 tests removed with it (432 total). The spec's "disambiguate by
chop styling... on long-press/tap" no longer applies — every chop looks
identical now, so disambiguation (if it's ever needed) would have to be
full-name-on-tap alone.

---

## 3. Realtime pick stamps — *(Sonnet)* — ✅ DONE `4c0deed` (signed-in members only — see below)

Tapping 揀呢個 stamps your chop onto the dish row with a small physical
"thunk" (scale+settle, ~200ms, respects prefers-reduced-motion) and
broadcasts via Supabase Realtime on the table session channel so every
member sees it land live. Un-picking lifts the stamp.

- A dish stamped by 2+ members gets the 全檯啱 treatment made PROMINENT —
  convergence is the emotional payoff; the UI celebrates overlap, not
  individual totals. Footer keeps running count + price.
- Multiple chops on one row: overlap-fan layout, capped visual stack with
  +N overflow.
- Guests (no account): may stamp; their chop uses their session handle.
  Their picks are session-scoped only (see item 4 for what they do NOT
  generate). On sign-up mid-session, their stamps re-key to the new account.
- Offline/late-join reconciliation: on channel join, fetch current pick
  state, then apply deltas — no ghost stamps.

**Tests:** realtime channel mock — stamp broadcast/receive, un-pick, late
join reconciliation, guest re-key on sign-up.

**Scoped down before starting, with the owner's sign-off:** this app has NO
anonymous-access path anywhere — every route requires a real Supabase
session (AuthGate + `auth.getUser()` 401 everywhere). Guest participation
means designing a new session-identity + RLS model from scratch, which is
an [F]-tier architecture decision, not a Sonnet side-effect of a stamps
feature. Split out as its own item below — build the rest now.

Shipped: `src/lib/tableStamps.ts` (stampsFromPicks/mergeStamps/
applyStampEvent, pure + 16 tests — the realtime "channel mock" from the
spec's own test plan, since this repo has no component/DOM harness). The
5s poll is the source of truth; broadcasts are a pure latency overlay
cleared on every fresh poll, which IS the late-join/offline reconciliation
the spec asked for — a client that missed a broadcast just self-heals on
its next poll, no separate reconciliation code needed. Un-pick added (the
picked button is now tappable, not a terminal disabled state) via the
existing `DELETE /api/my/dishes` — no new deletion path. 全檯啱 now fires
on either the item-1 predicted blend OR 2+ real stamps. Verified live with
two browser tabs on one session: pick/un-pick in one tab landed in the
other with zero reload.

---

## 3b. Guest (no-account) table participation — *(Fable 5)* — split out of item 3, 2026-07-21

Item 3's spec included "guests (no account) may stamp; their chop uses their
session handle... on sign-up mid-session, their stamps re-key to the new
account." Not built — deliberately, with the owner's sign-off before item 3
started.

**Why this is its own item, not a Sonnet afterthought:** this app has NO
anonymous-access path anywhere today. Every page is wrapped in `AuthGate`;
every API route does `supabase.auth.getUser()` and 401s without a real
session. "Guests may stamp" means designing, from scratch:
- how a guest's identity/handle is minted and where it lives for the
  duration of a table session (a cookie? an anonymous Supabase auth user?
  something table-session-scoped only?);
- what a guest is and isn't allowed to write under RLS — right now RLS
  assumes every writer is `auth.uid()`-backed;
- the re-key transaction on sign-up: a guest's existing stamps/picks need
  to move to their new real account without duplicating, orphaning, or
  losing anything, and without letting a malicious client claim someone
  else's guest stamps as their own.

That's a new auth surface with real security implications — the kind of
contract-touching, systemic decision that goes to the strongest model per
the standing model-tier convention (see CLAUDE.md's Model selection
section), not a UI side-effect of a stamps feature. Needs its own design
session before any code.

---

## 4. Companion edges (同檯 data layer) — *(Fable 5)*

Every CONFIRMED pick in a multi-member table session writes companion
edges: (user_a, user_b, dish_id, table_session_id, picked_at) for each
consenting member pair present. This is the "who you ate with" layer.

**Privacy lines (hard, decided):**
- Edges link accounts ONLY when both were consenting members of the same
  table session (joining a table = consent to be visible to that table).
- Guests generate NO edges until they have an account (and only for
  sessions after sign-up — no retroactive edge creation from pre-account
  stamps unless the re-key in item 3 happened within the live session).
- Export and UI speak display names only — never handles/emails/ids.
- RLS: a user can read only edges they are a party to. Verify policy with
  the standing dry-run pattern (pg_policy query + rolled-back insert).

**Payoffs to wire in this item (in order):**
1. 食記 entries show companion chops on shared-meal dishes.
2. AI export gains a companions layer — e.g. highest-rated dishes skew
   toward shared meals; frequent companions and the cuisines you explore
   together. Keep it to честная aggregate statements derived from real
   edges; no invented sociability. Feeds the export-versioning delta stream
   (a new companion appearing since last version is a legitimate delta
   line).
3. (Later, not this item) recurring-companion taste compatibility.

Schema design, RLS, and the export-prose judgment are why this is Fable 5.

---

## 5. 檯友回音 (Table Echo) — sealed mutual reveal — *(Fable 5, after item 4)*

The duel-class mechanic (standing directive: surface these when they fit —
this one hits all three criteria: fun, genuinely refines the engine,
near-zero new UI).

After the meal, every member who shared a picked dish gets the normal
rate-this-dish prompt — but for shared dishes, each verdict is SEALED until
all sharing members have rated (or a 48h timeout lapses), then reveals side
by side: 佢話超好味，你話麻麻地.

- Reuses `sealed_predictions` reveal UI wholesale; new seal type
  (`kind: 'echo'` or sibling table — implementer proposes, flags tradeoff).
- Engine value: two independent ratings of the SAME physical dish instance
  — the highest-density signal Dishi can collect; also begins separating
  dish-quality variance from taste variance (log it as such for the engine,
  even if not yet consumed).
- Sealing must be real: the other member's rating is not readable via any
  API before reveal conditions are met (RLS-enforced, not client-hidden —
  this is exactly the class of bug the sealed_predictions RLS incident
  taught us to test with dry-run queries).
- Timeout path: if only one member ever rates, their rating unseals to
  themselves normally at 48h; no nagging pushes.
- Quiet strategic note: echo teaches the seal mechanic through social use —
  capture reveal-open rates alongside the item-2 (version auto-seal)
  metrics for the deferred seal-education review.

**Tests:** RLS proof that an unrevealed echo rating is unreadable by the
counterpart; reveal on completion; timeout unseal; no echo for guest or
solo picks.

---

Build order: 1 → 2 → 3 (Sonnet, sequential — each depends on the prior),
then 4 → 5 (Fable 5). Item 5 must not start before 4's session/consent
model is merged. Photo avatars, companion compatibility scores, and any
table-level gamification are explicitly OUT of this batch.

**1 → 2 → 3 done** (`2f5b39b`, `5ca23a0`, `4c0deed`, 2026-07-21) — signed-in
members only; item 3's guest sub-scope split out to 3b (Fable 5, needs its
own design session — see above). 4 → 5 (Fable 5) and 3b remain.
