# Dishi Backlog

Single source of truth for OPEN work only. Triage/specs happen in the Claude
Project; execution happens in Claude Code. When an item ships: move its full
entry (rationale + amendments) into `docs/DECISIONS.md` with the commit hash,
don't just delete it — that file is where "why we did it this way" lives.
When a new item is decided anywhere: add it here and push.

Model tier per item: **[S]** = Sonnet (well-specified build) · **[F]** = Fable/Opus
(design decisions, entity resolution, diagnosis).

Audited 2026-07-22 against git history + live code (four items found
falsely open and archived: OTP login, 語言對 fixes, seal at pick time,
bilingual ingredients — see DECISIONS.md).

## Now — in progress

- [ ] **[F] dishi — your AI palate (export redesign) — §5 remainder.**
  §3/§4 SHIPPED `a3517b1` (persona voices 老實派/食家腔/貪玩 + persistence,
  `persona.ts`, `taste_profiles_persona.sql`); engine + payload work landed
  earlier. REMAINING: §5 UI + the voice-approval step. Review of the shipped
  portion deferred by owner ("later"). Engine-adjacent — use Opus/Fable.
  Full spec: `docs/specs/dishi-palate-export.md`.

## Ready to build — specs are decided, no open questions

- [ ] **[F] Carb-tripwire follow-up: honest vector re-score.** Open
  follow-up from the shipped carb-metonym work (DECISIONS.md, 07-20 batch
  item 4): the tripwire corrects ingredients/diet but not the 18-dim
  attribute VECTOR or an already-polluted NAME — honest vector re-score
  needs the name re-authored first (translate/vision + authority ladder).
  Costs one more LLM call per fire; recommended, cost accepted at triage.

## Needs an owner decision before any code

- [ ] **[F] Persona rethink (老實派 / 食家腔 / 貪玩) — dedicated design session.**
  The in-card picker was REMOVED from the export card (2026-07-21): as a row of
  chips it wasn't doing anything a user could feel. Open design question: where
  and how does a persona actually interact with the user? If the character is
  only "alive" after export inside the user's own AI, the whole feature needs a
  dedicated session to design and build (voice in the exported prompt is already
  implemented — `persona.ts` voices + persistence are kept, default 'honest').
  Also open: the 貪玩 blurb "鬼馬、生動、港式抵死" is defined by its Cantonese
  cheek — 書面化 would be a rename/reframe, decide in the same session.
- [ ] **[F] 食記 ordering for album logs.** Old camera-roll photos have a fuzzy
  eaten-date; decide: order journal by when-eaten vs when-logged, and how to
  capture an approximate eaten-date at log time without adding friction.
  Design conversation first — do not build straight from this line.
- [ ] **[F] Diet taxonomy growth (gluten, soy, nuts-general).** The 雞扎 fix took
  DIET_FLAGS from 7 → 13 (added poultry/lamb/egg/dairy/offal). Further allergen
  axes are real but each needs its own recipe-grounding thought — do NOT bolt them
  on ad hoc; keep the vocabulary closed and deliberate.

## Table Mode continuation — Fable-tier, in dependency order

- [ ] **[F] 3b. Guest (no-account) table participation** — new auth
  surface, needs its own design session first. Spec below.
- [ ] **[F] 5. 檯友回音 (Table Echo)** — item 4 (companion edges) SHIPPED
  2026-07-22 (see DECISIONS.md), so this is now unblocked. Spec below.

## Later / standing

- [ ] **Strategy: consumer scan density.** One dense neighborhood before
  expanding; no friend graph at this stage. Not a code item.
- Brainstormed, NOT confirmed (do not build): weekly recap card · web push
  re-entry triggers · revisit prompt ("would you order it again?") · 地雷
  dealbreaker probe · 排個名 restaurant mini-ranking · tempt-duel at scan time ·
  cold-start popularity ranking for profileless users · reverse taste import.

Done items, with full rationale and amendments, live in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

# Backlog additions — 2026-07-21 (Table Mode social: one surface, chops, echo)

Context: field session 18:41 HKT, two-person table R4E87. The joiner still
renders the PRE-redesign table layout (score rings, old cards) while the host
sees the new 你的最佳選擇 list — two products stapled together. Confirmed
design (Jerry): one shared surface; chop-first identity (photos later);
realtime pick stamps; companion data layer; 檯友回音 echo rider; guests
without accounts CAN stamp picks (friction kills tables) but generate no
companion edge / echo until sign-up — a deliberate conversion hook.

Strategic frame: two people picking at one table generates PAIRED dish-level
demand data no POS or QR vendor can see. Social is where the moat compounds.

**Build order:** 1 → 2 → 3 → 6 → 4 done (`2f5b39b`, `5ca23a0`, `4c0deed`,
2026-07-21; items 6 and 4, 2026-07-22 — full rationale + amendments in
`docs/DECISIONS.md`). Item 5 (檯友回音) is now unblocked. Photo avatars,
companion compatibility scores, and any table-level gamification are
explicitly OUT of this batch.

## 3b. Guest (no-account) table participation — *(Fable 5)* — split out of item 3, 2026-07-21

Item 3's spec included "guests (no account) may stamp; their chop uses their
session handle... on sign-up mid-session, their stamps re-key to the new
account." Not built — deliberately, with the owner's sign-off before item 3
started.

**Why this is its own item, not a Sonnet afterthought:** this app has NO
anonymous-access path anywhere today. Every page is wrapped in `AuthGate`;
every API route does `supabase.auth.getUser()` and 401s without a real
session. "Guests may stamp" means designing, from scratch:
- how a guest's identity/handle is minted and where it lives for the
  duration of a table session (a cookie? an anonymous Supabase auth user?
  something table-session-scoped only?);
- what a guest is and isn't allowed to write under RLS — right now RLS
  assumes every writer is `auth.uid()`-backed;
- the re-key transaction on sign-up: a guest's existing stamps/picks need
  to move to their new real account without duplicating, orphaning, or
  losing anything, and without letting a malicious client claim someone
  else's guest stamps as their own.

That's a new auth surface with real security implications — the kind of
contract-touching, systemic decision that goes to the strongest model per
the standing model-tier convention (see CLAUDE.md's Model selection
section), not a UI side-effect of a stamps feature. Needs its own design
session before any code.

## 5. 檯友回音 (Table Echo) — sealed mutual reveal — *(Fable 5, after item 4)*

The duel-class mechanic (standing directive: surface these when they fit —
this one hits all three criteria: fun, genuinely refines the engine,
near-zero new UI).

After the meal, every member who shared a picked dish gets the normal
rate-this-dish prompt — but for shared dishes, each verdict is SEALED until
all sharing members have rated (or a 48h timeout lapses), then reveals side
by side: 佢話超好味，你話麻麻地.

- Reuses `sealed_predictions` reveal UI wholesale; new seal type
  (`kind: 'echo'` or sibling table — implementer proposes, flags tradeoff).
- Engine value: two independent ratings of the SAME physical dish instance
  — the highest-density signal Dishi can collect; also begins separating
  dish-quality variance from taste variance (log it as such for the engine,
  even if not yet consumed).
- Sealing must be real: the other member's rating is not readable via any
  API before reveal conditions are met (RLS-enforced, not client-hidden —
  this is exactly the class of bug the sealed_predictions RLS incident
  taught us to test with dry-run queries).
- Timeout path: if only one member ever rates, their rating unseals to
  themselves normally at 48h; no nagging pushes.
- Quiet strategic note: echo teaches the seal mechanic through social use —
  capture reveal-open rates alongside the item-2 (version auto-seal)
  metrics for the deferred seal-education review.

**Tests:** RLS proof that an unrevealed echo rating is unreadable by the
counterpart; reveal on completion; timeout unseal; no echo for guest or
solo picks.
