# Dishi Backlog

Single source of truth for outstanding work. Triage/specs happen in the Claude
Project; execution happens in Claude Code. When an item ships: check it off with
the commit hash. When a new item is decided anywhere: add it here and push.

Model tier per item: **[S]** = Sonnet (well-specified build) · **[F]** = Fable/Opus
(design decisions, entity resolution, diagnosis).

## Now

_(nothing in flight — pull from Next)_

## Next

- [ ] **[S/F] Dish-detail view with full ingredients.** The summary cards now show
  only the common iconifiable ingredients as emoji (DishInfoDisplay), dropping the
  rest. The complete, text-labelled ingredient list should live in a dedicated
  dish-detail surface (likely a tab/expand on a dish) for a deeper view — decide
  the surface, then build. Supersedes the old "bilingual ingredient LINE" idea: the
  zh/en pairing still matters, but for that detail view, not the summary row.
- [ ] **[F] Diet taxonomy growth (gluten, soy, nuts-general).** The 雞扎 fix took
  DIET_FLAGS from 7 → 13 (added poultry/lamb/egg/dairy/offal). Further allergen
  axes are real but each needs its own recipe-grounding thought — do NOT bolt them
  on ad hoc; keep the vocabulary closed and deliberate.
- [ ] **[S] Seal at pick time.** Move seal creation (`POST /api/seals`) from
  queue-load to the pick-confirm moment on the scan page, so the prediction is
  committed when the user ORDERS, not when they next open the Taste tab.
  Strengthens the honesty framing; small change, endpoint already idempotent.
- [ ] **[F] 食記 ordering for album logs.** Old camera-roll photos have a fuzzy
  eaten-date; decide: order journal by when-eaten vs when-logged, and how to
  capture an approximate eaten-date at log time without adding friction.
  Design conversation first — do not build straight from this line.

## Later / standing

- [ ] **[F] Taste export as a recurring loop.** Versioned deltas shipped; open
  question is cadence and re-engagement (when/how the app invites a re-export).
- [ ] **Strategy: consumer scan density.** One dense neighborhood before
  expanding; no friend graph at this stage. Not a code item.

## Done (recent, for context)

- [x] Diet-flag integrity fix (雞扎 problem) — taxonomy 7→13, recipe-grounded
  enrichment, dietSuspicion tripwire, ingredients line surfaced, bounded backfill
  script. `52fd013`
- [x] Three-path log entry (餐廳菜/屋企煮/相簿舊相) — landed in the same commit
  as the diet-flag fix. `52fd013`
- [x] Sealed-bet mechanic end-to-end + RLS/admin-client fix (印 stamp live in prod)
- [x] Scan persistence across tab switches (`src/lib/scanSession.ts`)
- [x] Taste tab redesign: black radar, bold top-3, progress bar, stat sizing
- [x] Owner menu authority tier + `tests/ownerMenuReconcile.test.ts`
- [x] dishes.source constraint widened live (fixed silent no-photo log failure)
